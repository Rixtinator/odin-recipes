    <p>Some jummy pizza</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Water</strong> – Always use lukewarm water, make sure the
        temperature is between 98-105F (36-40C). Never use hot or you will kill
        the yeast and with cold water the yeast will take forever to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Yeast</strong> – I like to use active dry yeast but you could
        also use instant yeast, for every teaspoon of active dry yeast
        substitute with 3/4 teaspoon of instant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong> -It is considered food for the yeast, which
        converts it to carbon dioxide and alcohol. It also helps enhance the
        flavour of the pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Olive Oil</strong> – It helps to tenderize the dough and add a
        wonderful flavour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour</strong> – I usually use all purpose or bread flour, you
        will need a flour that has at least 12% protein. Bread flour will
        produce a chewier crust.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Salt</strong> – Is necessary to add flavour to the dough.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To start make sure your yeast is active,</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl add the water, make sure it is lukewarm (if it is too
        warm it will kill the yeast), then add a pinch of sugar to the water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the yeast over the top, stir to combine, then let it rest for
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the yeast is active it will dissolve in the water and the mixture
        will bubble.
      </li>
    </ol>
